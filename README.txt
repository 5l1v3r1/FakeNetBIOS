
Note to author: if you would like this pulled from Github, I understand and 
will do so without question. Since you have provided source I (@mubix) 
figured it would be a good way to get improvments into the package

FakeNetBIOS is a family of tools designed to simulate Windows hosts on a LAN.

The individual tools are:

  - FakeNetbiosDGM (NetBIOS Datagram)
  - FakeNetbiosNS (NetBIOS Name Service)
  - Maybe more later in the future: FakeNetbiosSSN (Session), FakeMS-DS, FakeRPC, etc.
    (please contact me if you are interested in participating in future enhancements).

Each tool can be used as a standalone tool or as a honeyd responder or subsystem.

Please read the following files for details about the individual tools:

  README_FakeNetbiosNS.txt
  README_FakeNetbiosDGM.txt
